            Waves-in-ice measurements are presented, obtained with a shipborne stereoscopic camera system in the Antarctic marginal ice zone during an extreme polar cyclone.
Data show large waves, significant wave height $\approx$5m 45 km in from the ice edge in 100\% sea-ice comprised of pancake floes (60\%) and interstitial frazil ice (40\%), and linear wave decay  ($\approx$0.72\%km$^{-1}$).
The dominant component of wave energy shifts towards longer periods as waves propagate deeper into sea ice, the spectrum becomes narrower in frequency and broader in direction.
Individual waves up to 8m high are observed $\approx$50 km in from the sea-ice edge, the largest wave measured in 100\% sea-ice, but consistent with occurrence probability predicted by linear wave theory.
Measurements reveal that wave-in-ice interactions remain intense in 100\% sea-ice.        </div>

The growing effects of global warming and rising sea levels have increased interest in studying the interaction between gravity waves and floating ice sheets in Polar Regions. This area of research is analogous to the interaction between surface gravity waves and very large floating structures (VLFSs) since both ice sheets and VLFSs are modeled as thin elastic plates. Examining the hydrodynamic performance of these floating structures is essential due to their widespread application in the utilisation of ocean space for both humanitarian and technical purposes. A lot of current research is focused on wave-structure interaction problems with man-made seabed structures for technical purposes. On the other hand, not as much research has been done to understand how natural features like sand ripples and bars affect flexural gravity waves. The interaction of incident progressive waves with undulated sandbars results in resonant conditions leading to the formation of triads. The multi-scale method is used to derive the envelope equations for flexural gravity waves, which are subsequently used to understand the role of detuned frequency to account for the Bragg resonance. The study reveals in the presence of a detuned frequency the occurrence of a cut-off frequency, below which wave reflection is monotonic and above which it becomes oscillatory. However, Bragg scattering occurs in the presence of multiple sinusoidal patches, having harmonic and sub-harmonic peaks in wave reflection. Subsequently, the scattering coefficients are analysed in the context of flexural gravity waves across a spectrum of physical parameters involving the floating ice sheet and sea bed configurations. Further studies are being attempted to enhance the understanding of flexural gravity wave propagation over sinusoidal beds of varied configurations.        </div>

        <div style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 20px ; text-align: justify;">
            <p>In the present study, the linear theory for flexural gravity waves impinging obliquely on dual inverse Π-type breakwaters, which are bottom standing structures consist of a pair of thin vertical plates extending upward, is examined in finite fluid-depth. The study’s primary aim is to investigate the effect of adding two vertical thin plates with a rectangular structure beneath an ice-covered water surface. The ice cover is modeled as a thin, flexible plate of uniform thickness, assuming the Euler–Bernoulli beam equation governs its motion. To tackle this boundary value problem, a system of Fredholm-type integral equations is derived, utilizing mode-coupling relations. The multi-term Galerkin method is employed to solve the equations, effectively addressing the half singularities at the sharp submerged edges of the thin plates. Chebyshev polynomials, multiplied by associated weight functions, are selected as the basis functions for the Galerkin technique, ensuring convergence of the solution. This approach enables a detailed exploration of wave interaction with the breakwater-ice system under a variety of structural parameters. The study examines key physical quantities, including the reflection coefficient, transmission coefficient, and horizontal wave force. These quantities are computed and analyzed across various configurations to understand their behavior and sensitivity to structural changes. To ensure the accuracy and reliability of the results, comparisons are made with existing studies for several limiting cases, confirming the validity of the findings. A comparative analysis between inverse Π-type and conventional rectangular breakwaters reveals that adding thin plates on either side of a rectangular breakwater significantly enhances its wave-scattering efficiency. The study reveals that Bragg resonance effects depend on both the thickness of the ice sheet and the submergence gap between the ice-covered surface and the breakwater. The ice cover's thickness, in particular, plays a critical role in improving the breakwater’s performance: as the ice sheet thickness increases, the surface displacement amplitude in the transmitted wave region diminishes, while the wavelength remains unchanged. Furthermore, the study demonstrates that the addition of these thin plates results in a marked reduction in surface displacement amplitude within the transmitted region, thus creating an ideal tranquil zone. These results highlight the potential of dual inverse Π-type breakwaters to effectively scatter waves while offering significant benefits in coastal protection, particularly in ice-covered regions. The findings offer practical insights for the design and deployment of more effective wave-interaction structures in real-world marine environments.</p>

            <p> This study examines the scattering of obliquely incident water waves by a horizontal floating flexible, permeable viscoelastic membrane in finite water depth and placed over variable rigid seabed topography in the context of three-dimensional linear water wave theory. The physical problem when a partially reflection vertical seawall is placed downstream of the membrane is also considered. The problem is studied under the potential water wave theory assumption, with two types of variable bottom topographies. The eigenfunction expansion-boundary element method is used to derive the different results based on different physical and structural parameters. Also, the finite difference method is coupled with the boundary element method to handle the membrane's dynamic boundary condition containing a second-order derivative. The accuracy of the numerical results is verified by deriving and using energy balance relations for water wave scattering by floating flexible porous membrane and when a vertical partial reflection wall is situated downstream of the membrane. This study examines the impact of sinusoidally varying bottom topography, membrane's damping parameter, and incident wave heading angle on the different wave transformation characteristics. The results of the present investigation indicate that the viscoelastic characteristics of the membrane contribute to extending its lifespan and can be utilized to create a calm zone on the lee side of the membrane barriers.</p>

        <div style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 20px ; text-align: justify;">
            <p>We present an advanced theoretical study of frequency downshifting in
                wavetrains propagating on the ocean surface covered by ice floes. Using
                the empirical model which suggests that small-amplitude surface waves in
                such an environment decay exponentially with the spatial rate depending
                on the frequency, k<sub>i</sub>  <span>&#8764;</span> w<sup>n</sup>, we derive the downshifting within the
                wavetrain described by the linear theory. We show that such downshifting
                appears due to the faster decay of high-frequency components compared to
                the low-frequency with no energy flux along the spectrum. The
                alternative weakly nonlinear model is considered within the framework of
                the nonlinear Schrödinger (NLS) equation augment by the empirical
                dissipative terms. This model describes the propagation and decay of
                wavetrains in the form of envelope solitons and accounts for an energy
                flux along the spectrum down to lower frequencies. For the relatively
                small dissipation, we derive the frequency downshift in the solitons
                with the help of the asymptotic approach. The comparison of the
                downshifting obtained within the framework of linear and nonlinear
                models shows that in the latter case the frequency downshifting is
                notably less in comparison with the former case. In conclusion,
                estimates for the real oceanic conditions will be provided.</p>

        <div style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 20px ; text-align: justify;">
            <p>There has been rising interest in ice shelf flexure produced by ocean
                waves due to a combination of recent theoretical studies and observed
                calving events. Current mathematical models that explore the flexure of
                ice shelves induced by ocean waves often employ a simplified uniform
                geometry, consisting of constant shelf thickness and seabed. Bennetts et
                al. (2022) introduced an efficient mathematical model of the
                wave-induced shelf flexure for the non-uniform geometry of the Ross Ice
                Shelf taken from the BEDMAP2 dataset. The results showed significant
                impact of shelf geometry and wave period on flexural strain.</p>
            <p> The
                presented study further investigates the impact of geometrical
                variations on shelf flexure. It extends the work of Bennetts et al.
                (2022) to multiple ice shelves, providing statistical relationships
                between shelf flexure and ice shelf thickness and seabed variation
                across the range of wave periods (swell, infra-gravity, and extremely
                long period waves).<br />

        <div style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 20px ; text-align: justify;">
            <p>Studying the interaction between ocean waves and sea ice cover is
                essential for ensuring safety operations within the polar region and
                investigating the effects of climate change. However, while spectral
                wave modelling in open ocean areas has achieved high accuracy, modelling
                in the marginal ice zone remains challenging and is associated with
                relatively large errors. This challenge primarily stems from the limited
                availability of observations of waves in sea ice. In the present study,
                the wave-buoy analogy approach is applied to the extensive ship motion
                datasets collected during the cruises in the Southern Ocean to produce
                wave spectra estimates. By applying the transfer function called the
                response amplitude operator (RAO), the ship response spectrum can be
                translated into wave energy spectrum. The RAO is computed utilizing the
                ship hydrodynamic model NEMOH. The input includes the hull geometry with
                an estimated draft, as the actual draft is unavailable. The RAO is then
                calibrated by adjusting the draft and comparing the significant wave
                height of the measured wave spectra with the satellite altimeter
                observations, relying on the altimeter’s accuracy over open ocean, until
                the difference between them is minimised. The sea state parameters from
                the corrected spectra show good agreement with those from the ERA5
                reanalysis dataset. In the next step, wave attenuation is analyzed based
                on this database of wave spectra. Results show a power-law relationship
                between attenuation rate and frequency, which has been reported in
                several previous studies, and the power value we obtained is comparable
                to previous findings.</p>

        <div style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 20px ; text-align: justify;">
            <p>Coastal polynyas are areas of open water enclosed by winter sea-ice in Antarctica.
                Polynyas significantly impact atmospheric, cryospheric and oceanic processes on different
                spatial and temporal scales. Very cold, local high-speed winds drive the sea-ice away from
                the coast, while at the same time intensifying the generation of new sea-ice. The associated
                brine rejection leads to formation of very dense shelf-water. This dense water mass
                eventually drives the global thermohaline circulation and ventilates the world’s deep ocean
                benthic eco-systems.</p>
            <p>For studying future climate, it is important to include the formation and the intense
                sea-ice production of coastal polynyas in global climate models. Currently they are not
                represented because the various polynya associated processes act on length scales below the
                resolution limit of global simulations.</p>
            <p>This project addresses two research questions using Machine Learning algorithms.
                First, how does the shape of local coastal topography promote or inhibit the occurrence of
                coastal polynyas. Second, how large-scale synoptic processes trigger and enhance local high speed winds under the influence of regional orography. In a two-stage approach, we first train
                a Random Forest (RF) algorithm using surface winds, coastline shape and sea-ice freeboard
                as input variables. Then, large-scale pressure and gradient wind variables will be added for
                training. The expected output from the RF-Classifier represents the binary prediction of
                polynya occurrence, the RF-Regressor predicts the area of polynyas. The overall objective is
                to predict polynyas using regional topography and large-scale atmospheric circulation only,
                thus avoiding the need to resolve local processes in climate models.</p>

        <div style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 20px ; text-align: justify;">
            <p>The two-dimensional nonlinear problem of a steady flow in a channel
                covered by broken ice with an arbitrary bottom topography including a
                semi-circular obstruction is considered. The mathematical model is based
                on the velocity potential theory accounting for nonlinear boundary
                conditions on the bottom of the channel and at the interface between the
                liquid and the layer of the broken ice, which are coupled through a
                numerical procedure. A mass loading model together with a viscous layer
                model is used to model the ice cover. The integral hodograph method is
                employed to derive the complex velocity potential of the flow, which
                contains the velocity magnitude at the interface in explicit form. The
                coupled problem is reduced to a system of integral equations in the
                unknown velocity magnitude at the interface, which is solved numerically
                using a collocation method. Case studies are conducted both for the
                subcritical and for the supercritical flow regimes in the channel. For
                subcritical flows, it is found that the ice cover allows for generating
                waves with amplitudes larger than those that may exist in the free
                surface case; the ice cover prevents the formation of a cusp and extends
                the solution to larger obstruction heights on the bottom. For
                supercritical flow regimes, the broken ice significantly affects the
                waveform of the soliton wave making it gentler. The viscosity factor of
                the model apparently governs the wave attenuation.</p>

            <p>Hydroelastic wave propagation in an ice-covered channel for the
                compressed ice cover has been investigated. The channel has a
                rectangular cross-section. The fluid in the channel is inviscid,
                incompressible and covered with ice. The ice is modeled as a thin
                elastic plate. Cases of ice compression along the channel and across the
                channel are considered.</p>
            <p>Methods for obtaining dispersion relations and determining critical
                velocities with the help of normal modes for uniform non-compressed
                plates have been developed. The problem is reduced to the problem of the
                wave profiles across the channel. The solution to the considered problem
                is obtained in the form of a series of the vibration modes of an elastic
                beam without compression; see [1-3]. It is shown that phase velocities
                and values of the frequencies of propagating waves stay low with
                increasing compression. Abnormal behaviour was observed for the first
                mode of “very compressed” ice if the compression was along the channel.
                For compression across the channel, the existence of two modes with the
                same frequency was found. It was obtained that the second mode wave can
                propagate faster than the first mode wave in the case of “very
                compressed” ice.<br />

            <p>Linear hydroelastic waves propagating in an ice channel are
                investigated. The ice thickness is constant along the channel and
                variable across the channel. The channel is a rectangular cross-section
                with finite depth and infinite extent. The liquid in the channel is
                inviscid and incompressible. The liquid flow caused by the ice
                deflection has potential. The ice is modeled by a thin elastic plate
                clamped to the channel walls. The coupled hydroelastic problem is
                reduced to the problem of the wave profiles across the channel. The wave
                profiles are sought as a series of normal dry modes of the plate, the
                coefficients of which are to be determined. The dispersion relations of
                these hydroelastic waves, their phase speeds, and their profiles across
                the channel are determined.</p>
            <p>Two cases of variation in the ice thickness are considered. The first
                case is symmetric linear change with respect to the centre of the
                channel. The second case is an arbitrary shape of the ice thickness. In
                both cases, the method of construction of the normal dry modes are
                presented. In the first case the solution is obtained in the form of a
                series of Bessel functions using symmetry of the wave profiles. The
                normal modes of the plate with an arbitrary thickness are calculated
                using piecewise linear approximation of the plate thickness. These modes
                are such that the corresponding deflections, slopes, bending stresses
                and shear forces are continuous. The modes are presented by Bessel
                functions in the intervals, where the plate thickness is linear, and by
                trigonometric and hyperbolic functions, where the thickness is
                approximated as constant.</p>

            <p>This study is about wave-ice interactions in the marginal ice zone
                (MIZ). We compare simulations using recent three-dimensional
                formulations for wave-ice interactions and the scattering of ocean
                surface waves by flexible ice floes, with older parameterizations and
                field observations. These parameterizations are implemented in a modern
                version of the wave model WAVEWATCH III®, as source terms in the action
                balance equation. Field observations consist of wave characteristics
                collected during the Arctic Sea State Boundary Layer Experiment of 2015
                in the Beaufort Sea. Comparisons focus wave heights, 1-dimensional and

            <p>The attenuation of ocean surface waves in seasonal sea ice and resulting
                sea ice motion is challenging to observe with conventional methods using
                sparse mooring or buoy arrays. A novel method for persistent observation
                of wave-ice interactions using distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) along
                seafloor fiber optic telecommunication cables is applied to 36-km
                cross-shore cable in the Alaskan Arctic on the Beaufort Shelf. DAS
                optical sensing of fiber strain-rate provides a proxy for seafloor
                pressure, which we calibrate with wave buoy measurements during the
                ice-free season (August 2022). This calibration is applied to the ice
                formation season (November 2021) to obtain unprecedented resolution of
                variable wave attenuation rates in new, partial ice cover. The rapid
                evolution of the location and strength of attenuation serves as proxy
                for the evolution of ice coverage and thickness, especially during
                rapidly evolving events. Results suggest that higher attenuation rates
                previously observed near the ice-edge may be a result of wave-ice
                interactions leading to ice compaction and increased thickness. Such

            <p>The two-dimensional unsteady problem of a rigid cylinder moving
                vertically in a liquid covered by an elastic thin plate of infinite
                extent is studied. The liquid is incompressible and inviscid. The flow
                caused by the body motion is potential. Deflections of the elastic plate
                are assumed small compared with the radius of the cylinder. The boundary
                condition on the plate/liquid interface is linearised and imposed on the
                initial equilibrium level of the plate. It is shown that the problem is
                coupled for impulsive motions of the body and decoupled if the body
                acceleration is moderate. The coupled problem is solved using the
                conformal mapping of the flow region onto a ring and the method of
                separation of variables applied to both the hydrodynamic and structural
                parts of the problem. This study is restricted to the constant speed of
                the cylinder motion towards the ice plate. The effect of the nonlinear
                term in the hydrodynamic pressure acting on the plate/liquid interface
                on the response of the ice plate is also investigated.</p>

            <p>We present an update on an ongoing effort to measure ocean surface waves
                and sea ice in the central Beaufort Sea of the western Arctic. The time

                ice draft estimates at two mooring locations within the Beaufort Gyre
                Observing System (BGOS). The data products are publicly available and

        <div style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 20px ; text-align: justify;">
            <p>Recent decades have seen a rise in ocean engineering research on the interaction between surface gravity waves and large floating structures. Wave-ice interaction in cold region science and technology is another field of investigation. Both problems consider the structures to be thin, homogenous, isotropic flexible plate. The hydroelastic properties of these structures are explored by analyzing flexural gravity waves resulting due to the interaction of surface gravity waves with the large floating structures. Furthermore, ocean currents, which occur in virtually every region of the ocean, contribute to the complexity of the issues. Recent research pertaining to wave-structure interaction problems has revealed the phenomenon of wave blocking, which occurs due to the interaction between flexural gravity waves and ocean current. The interaction leads to the existence of multiple propagating wave modes within certain frequency limits, which vary with the speed of the current.</p>
            <p>
                In this study, flexural gravity waves interact with shear current having constant vorticity within the blocking limit to form triads in finite water depth with compressive force. Triad formations are explored geometrically using Ball's diagram for different compressive force and current speed values. The study assumes small amplitude water wave theory and homogeneous fluid structure response for finite water depth. This study shows that at least three triads occur for certain frequencies within the blocking limits, depending on co-current/counter-current interaction with flexural gravity waves, compressive force, and current speed.</p>

        <div style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 20px ; text-align: justify;">
            <p>The study of ocean wave propagation through floating ice sheets has
                gained significant attention owing to its relevance in the polar
                region’s science and technology. Further, various geophysical processes,
                viz., upwelling, wind stresses and geothermal effects, could have a
                notable impact on ice sheets in polar regions. Besides, there are open
                water unfrozen areas within the ice-covered ocean known as polynyas,
                which are created in areas where the ice motion is divergent because of
                the prevailing winds or oceanic currents. It is interesting to know the
                interaction of flexural gravity waves outside these polynyas with the
                surface gravity waves within these polynyas. Of particular interest is
                the phenomenon of wave blocking, a distinctive characteristic associated
                with the propagation of flexural gravity waves. This phenomenon unveils
                the presence of multiple propagating wave modes within specific periods
                under the influence of lateral compressive forces. Recent studies on
                flexural gravity waves have unveiled that wave blocking occurs when the
                group velocity reaches zero while the phase velocity remains positive
                for distinct periods. In the present analysis, the scattering of
                flexural gravity waves by a circular polynya within the regime of wave
                blocking is studied in finite water depth. The Fourier-Bessel series
                expansion is employed to determine the velocity potential for single and
                multiple propagating wave modes within the ice sheet. The study further
                investigates the influence of various hydrodynamic and structural
                parameters on the scattered wave field, wave elevation within the
                polynya, and the strain rate experienced by the ice sheet.</p>

        <p align="center"> Abstract </p>
        <div style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 20px ; text-align: justify;">
            <p>In the past few decades, a significant progress is observed in the study
                on surface gravity wave interaction with large floating ice sheets or a
                large-scale ice floes stripped from the ice sheet in the marginal ice
                zone (MIZ) due to rise in global temperature as well as global warming.
                In most of the studies, large floating ice sheets are considered as an
                infinitely extended thin floating elastic plate, however, due to strong
                wind, high waves and temperature variation the ice sheets in the
                marginal ice zone behaves like fractured ice. Furthermore, the study on
                wave-ice interaction problems becomes more complex with the inclusion of
                the role of ocean current. Since, the dispersion curve loses its
                symmetricity about the axes and as a result for each frequency
                two-distinct wavenumbers exists.</p>
            <p>The present study deals with the surface gravity wave propagation in
                the presence of current in which the ice sheet is considered as
                fractured ice under the assumption of linearized theory of water waves
                and small amplitude structural response. Emphasis is given to
                investigate numerically the floe size distribution of a large scale ice
                floe in the presence of current in a water of infinite depth. The
                simulative study is based on CFD-DEM method in which volume of fluid
                (VOF) method is used to simulate the water phase and discrete element
                method (DEM) is considered to model the large scale floating ice. In
                addition, a probability distribution, namely, Weibull distribution is
                considered for analyzing floe size distribution (FSD). The impact of
                wave-current field on a large-scale floating ice in established based on
                a two and three dimensional wave numerical model. The study reveals that
                the fracture length changes with a change in the current, which is due
                to the change in wavelength for the same frequency. Additionally, the
                presence of current causes the drift motion of the ice sheets. Moreover,
                it is observed that the size distribution of fractured ice is uniform in
                the case of following current, whilst the same becomes concentrated in a
                small scale range in the case of opposing current. Additionally, the
                averaged normalized size of the broken ice increases/decreases in the
                presence of following/opposing current. This is because of the fact that
                wavelength increases (decreases) as the wave propagates in the same
                (opposite) direction of current.</p>

            <p>Utilizing the linearized theory of water waves, we examine a model that
                delves into the scattering of oblique waves by obstacles. The obstacles,
                in this case, take the form of thin multiple surface-piercing porous
                barriers characterized by non-uniform porosity. The study is conducted
                within the context of a flexible ocean bed of uniform finite depth. The
                flexible base surface is represented as a thin elastic plate, relating
                to the Euler–Bernoulli beam equation. Employing the eigenfunction
                expansion method and mode-coupling relations, we derive four
                Fredholm-type integral equations from the boundary value problem. To
                solve these integral equations, multi-term Galerkin approximations are
                applied using Chebyshev polynomials multiplied by appropriate weight
                functions. The obtained analytic solutions reveal various hydrodynamic
                quantities such as reflection coefficients, transmission coefficients,
                dissipated wave energy, and non-dimensional wave force. These quantities
                are graphically presented for different values of dimensionless
                parameters. Notably, the graphical representations highlight the
                significant influence of barrier permeability and bottom surface

                presence of an elastic plate within the framework of linearized water
                wave theory. The wave passed the thick porous structure employs the
                Sollitt and Cross model, while the elastic plate is modelled using the
                thin plate theory. Utilizing the eigenfunction expansion method, the
                corresponding boundary value problem is transformed into a set of linear

        <div style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 20px ; text-align: justify;">
            <p>Flexural gravity waves are generated due to the interaction of surface
                gravity waves with a floating flexible plate. These waves are the result
                of the interplay between gravitational forces and elastic bending,
                making them distinct from conventional surface gravity waves. In coastal
                environments as well as in polar regions, the interactions of flexural
                gravity waves with bottom steps and submerged breakwaters are of
                significant importance. The recent study on blocking dynamics of
                flexural gravity waves has revealed the existence of multiple
                propagating wave modes for certain frequency and lateral compressive
                force, whilst major studies on flexural gravity wave transformation are
                limited to single propagating wave. Besides, the higher-order boundary
                condition on the ice-covered ocean surface in wave-ice interaction
                problems add additional challenges since the vertical eigenfunctions
                involving flexural gravity waves are not orthogonal in the classical
                sense. In this presentation, flexural gravity wave scattering due to
                step type undulated sea bed is studied in the case of multiple
                propagating waves. The method is extended to the case of a submerged
                rectangular breakwater and trenches using geometrical symmetry. The
                orthogonal eigenfunctions associated with surface gravity waves are used
                to develop a system of equations in the eigenfunction expansion method
                involving the flexural gravity wave problem, which is found to be much
                easier than the use of the orthogonal mode-coupling relation associated
                with flexural gravity waves. The energy balance relation is obtained to
                account for multiple propagating wave mode and is used to validate the
                computational result. Various numerical results will be presented to
                demonstrate the effect of multiple propagating waves in the context of
                wave blocking.</p>
